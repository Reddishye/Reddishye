## About Me :star2:

I'm Hugo Torres, known in the digital universe as **Reddishye** or **Redactado**. My passion for development and design has led me to create projects that are not only functional but also visually appealing. My favorite colors, pink and purple, reflect my creative and dreamy personality.

## Featured Projects ✨

- **SpaceMC Newtork**: Including plugins like:
  - **SpaceNightVision**: A simple night vision plugin that fixes issues most of the plugins have.
  - **RandomUtils**: A plugin with a high-variety of features, including:
      - Timed Blocks
      - Protected Regions (customize with a detailed system of filters when to cancel block placement or break)
      - Night Vision (integrated SpaceNightVision into randomutils, however, SNV is OSS and RandomUtils closed source)
      - Rankup System with command execution per rankup on death (made for RandomKits servers)
      - Spawn teleportation
      - Economy blocks with multi-currency support
      - Basic death cosmetics with Cross-Server support
- **Redactado's Hub**: Minecraft plugin development, including:
  - **Orbit**: Hub Core plugin.
  - **RTimers**: HCF style timers for TAB plugin.
- **STN-Studios Transcripts**: Developer for the transcript panel of the STN-Studios development hub.
